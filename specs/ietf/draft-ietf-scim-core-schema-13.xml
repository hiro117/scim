    <abstract>
      <t>The System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) specifications
      are designed to make identity management in cloud based applications and
      services easier. The specification suite builds upon experience with
      existing schemas and deployments, placing specific emphasis on
      simplicity of development and integration, while applying existing
      authentication, authorization, and privacy models. Its intent is to
      reduce the cost and complexity of user management operations by
      providing a common user schema and extension model, as well as binding
      documents to provide patterns for exchanging this schema using HTTP
      protocol.</t>

      <t>This document provides a platform neutral schema and extension model
      for representing users and groups and other resource types in JSON
      format. This schema is intended for exchange and use with cloud service
      providers.</t>

    <section anchor="overview" title="Introduction and Overview">
      <t>While there are existing standards for describing and exchanging user
      information, many of these standards can be difficult to implement
      and/or use; e.g., their wire protocols do not easily traverse firewalls
      and/or are not easily layered onto existing web protocols. As a result,
      many cloud providers implement non-standardized protocols for managing
      users within their services. This increases both the cost and complexity
      associated with organizations adopting products and services from
      multiple cloud providers as they must perform redundant integration
      development. Similarly, cloud services providers seeking to
      inter-operate with multiple application marketplaces or cloud identity
      providers must be redundantly integrated.</t>

      <t>SCIM seeks to simplify this problem through a simple to implement
      specification suite that provides a common user schema and extension
      model, as well as binding documents to provide patterns for exchanging
      this schema via an HTTP based protocol. It draws inspiration and best
      practice, building upon existing user protocols and schemas from a wide
      variety of sources including, but not limited to, existing services
      exposed by cloud providers, PortableContacts, vCards, and LDAP directory
      services.</t>

      <t>This document provides a JSON based schema and extension model for
      representing users and groups, as well as service provider
      configuration. This schema is intended for exchange and use with cloud
      service providers and other cross-domain scenarios. An HTTP
      protocol-binding document is provided separately.</t>

    <section anchor="schema_structure" title="SCIM Schema Data Types">
      <t>SCIM schema provides a minimal core schema for representing users and
      groups (resources), encompassing common attributes found in many
      existing deployments and schemas. In addition to the minimal core
      schema, this document also specifies a standardized means by which
      service providers may extend schema to define new resources and
      attributes in both standardized and service provider specific cases.</t>

      <t>Resources are categorized into common resource types such as <spanx
      style="verb">User</spanx> or <spanx style="verb">Group</spanx>).
      Collections of resources of the same type are usually contained within
      the same "container" ("folder") endpoint.</t>

      <t>A resource is a collection of attributes identified by one or more
      schemas. Minimally, an attribute consists of the attribute name and at
      least one simple or complex value either of which may be multi-valued.
      For each attribute, SCIM schema defines the data type, plurality,
      mutability, and other distinguishing features of an attribute.</t>

      <t>Attribute names SHOULD be camel-cased (e.g. "camelCase"). SCIM
      resources are represented in JSON <xref target="RFC7159"/> and MUST
      specify schema via the <spanx style="verb">schemas</spanx> attribute per

        considered schema extensions.</t>

        <t>For backwards compatibility reasons, some existing schema MAY list
        common attributes as part of the schema. The attribute characteristics
        listed here SHALL take precedence.</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="id"><vspace/>A unique identifier for a SCIM resource
            as defined by the service provider. Each representation of the
            resource MUST include a non-empty <spanx style="verb">id</spanx>
            value. This identifier MUST be unique across the SCIM service
            provider's entire set of resources. It MUST be a stable,
            non-reassignable identifier that does not change when the same
            resource is returned in subsequent requests. The value of the
            <spanx style="verb">id</spanx> attribute is always issued by the
            service provider and MUST NOT be specified by the client. The
            string <spanx style="verb">bulkId</spanx> is a reserved keyword
            and MUST NOT be used within any unique identifier value. REQUIRED
            and has a mutability of <spanx style="verb">readOnly</spanx>. See
            <xref target="security"/> for additional considerations regarding
            privacy.</t>

            <t hangText="externalId"><vspace/>A String that is an identifier
            for the resource as defined by the provisioning client. The <spanx
            style="verb">externalId</spanx> may simplify identification of a
            resource between the provisioning client and the service provider
            by allowing the client to use a filter to locate the resource with
            an identifier from the provisioning domain, obviating the need to
            store a local mapping between the provisioning domain's identifier
            of the resource and the identifier used by the service provider.
            Each resource MAY include a non-empty <spanx style="verb">externalId</spanx>
            value. The value of the <spanx style="verb">externalId</spanx>
            attribute is always issued by the provisioning client and MUST NOT
            be specified by the service provider. The service provider MUST
            always interpret the externalId as scoped to the client's tenant.
            While the server does not enforce uniqueness, it is assumed that
            the value's uniqueness is controlled by the client setting the
            value. See <xref target="security"/> for additional considerations
            regarding privacy.</t>

            <t hangText="meta"><vspace/>A complex attribute containing
            resource metadata. All sub-attributes are OPTIONAL and are
            asserted by the Service Provider: <list style="hanging">
                <t hangText="resourceType">The name of the resource type of

                <t hangText="created">The DateTime the resource was added to
                the service provider. The attribute MUST be a DateTime. This
                attribute has mutability of <spanx style="verb">readOnly</spanx>.</t>

                <t hangText="lastModified">The most recent DateTime the
                details of this resource were updated at the service provider.
                If this resource has never been modified since its initial
                creation, the value MUST be the same as the value of created.
                The attribute MUST be a DateTime and has mutability of <spanx
                style="verb">readOnly</spanx>.</t>

                <t hangText="location">The URI of the resource being returned.
                This value MUST be the same as the Location HTTP response
                header. The attribute has mutability of <spanx style="verb">readOnly</spanx>.</t>

                <t hangText="version">The version of the resource being
                returned. This value must be the same as the ETag HTTP

      <section anchor="scim-extension" title="Defining New Resource Types">
        <t>SCIM may be extended to define new classes of resources by defining
        a resource type. Each resource type defines the name, endpoint, base
        schema (the attributes), and any schema extensions registered for use
        with the resource type. In order to offer new types of resources, a
        service provider defines the new resource type as specified in <xref
        target="resource-type-schema"/>and defines a schema representation
        (see <xref target="schema-representation"/>).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Attribute Extensions to Resources">
        <t>SCIM allows resource types to have extensions in addition to their
        core schema. This is similar to how <spanx style="verb">ObjectClasses</spanx>
        used in LDAP. However, unlike LDAP there is no inheritance model; all
        extensions are additive (similar to LDAP Auxiliary Object Class <xref
        target="RFC4512"/> ). Each <spanx style="verb">schemas</spanx> value
        indicates additive schema that may exist in a SCIM resource
        representation. The <spanx style="verb">schemas</spanx> attribute MUST
        contain at least one value which SHALL be the base schema for the
        resource. The <spanx style="verb">schemas</spanx> attribute MAY
        contain additional values indicating extended schemas that are in use.
        Schema extensions SHOULD avoid redefining any attributes defined in
        this specification and SHOULD follow conventions defined in this
        specification. Except for the base object schema, the schema extension
        URI SHALL be used as a JSON container to distinguish attributes
        belonging to the extension namespace from base schema attributes. See
        <xref target="enterpriseUserJSON"/> for an example JSON representation
        of an extended User.</t>

        <t>In order to determine which <spanx style="verb">schemas</spanx> URI
        value is the base schema and which is extended schema for any given
        resource, the resource's <spanx style="verb">resourceType</spanx>
        attribute value MAY be used to retrieve the resource's <spanx
        style="verb">ResourceType</spanx> schema ( <xref
        target="resource-type-schema"/> ). See example <spanx style="verb">ResourceType</spanx>
        representation in <xref target="resourceTypeJSON"/>.</t>

      <section anchor="user-resource" title="User Resource Schema">

              authenticate to the service provider. Often displayed to the
              user as their unique identifier within the system (as opposed to
              <spanx style="verb">id</spanx> or <spanx style="verb">externalId</spanx>,
              which are generally opaque and not user-friendly identifiers).
              Each User MUST include a non-empty userName value. This

              <t hangText="name"><vspace/>The components of the user's real
              name. Service providers MAY return just the full name as a
              single string in the formatted sub-attribute, or they MAY return
              just the individual component attributes using the other
              sub-attributes, or they MAY return both. If both variants are
              returned, they SHOULD be describing the same name, with the

              <t hangText="displayName"><vspace/>The name of the user,
              suitable for display to end-users. Each user returned MAY
              include a non-empty displayName value. The name SHOULD be the
              full name of the User being described if known (e.g. <spanx

              ), but MAY be a username or handle, if that is all that is
              available (e.g. <spanx style="verb">bjensen</spanx> ). The value

              <spanx style="verb">Bobby</spanx> instead of <spanx
              style="verb">Robert</spanx>. This attribute SHOULD NOT be used
              to represent a User's username (e.g. bjensen or

              <t anchor="preferredLanguage"
              hangText="preferredLanguage"><vspace/>Indicates the user's
              preferred written or spoken languages and is generally used for
              selecting a localized User interface. The value indicates the
              set of natural languages that are preferred. The format of the
              value is same as the Accept-Language header field (not including
              "Accept-Language:") of HTTP and is specified in <xref
              target="RFC7231">Section 5.3.5 of</xref>. The intent of this
              value is to enable cloud applications to perform matching of
              language tags <xref target="RFC4647"/> to the user's language
              preferences regardless of what may be indicated by a user agent

              (such as in a delegated OAuth2 <xref target="RFC6749"/> style
              interaction) where normal HTTP Accept-Language header
              negotiation cannot take place.</t>

              <t hangText="locale"><vspace/>Used to indicate the User's
              default location for purposes of localizing items such as
              currency, date time format, numerical representations, etc. A
              valid value is a language tag as defined in <xref
              target="RFC5646"/>. Computer languages are explicitly
              excluded.</t>

              <t>A language tag is a sequence of one or more case-insensitive
              sub-tags, each separated by a hyphen character ("-", %x2D). For
              backwards compatibility reasons, servers MAY accept tags
              separated by an underscore character ("_", %5F). In most cases,
              a language tag consists of a primary language sub-tag that
              identifies a broad family of related languages (e.g., "en" =
              English) which is optionally followed by a series of sub-tags
              that refine or narrow that language's range (e.g., "en-CA" = the
              variety of English as communicated in Canada). Whitespace is not
              allowed within a language tag. Example tags include: <figure
                  align="center">
                  <artwork align="center">fr, en-US, es-419, az-Arab, x-pig-latin, man-Nkoo-GN</artwork>
                </figure> See <xref target="RFC5646"/> for further
              information.</t>

              <t hangText="timezone"><vspace/>The User's time zone in IANA
              Time Zone database format <xref target="RFC6557"/>, also known
              as "Olson" timezone database format <xref target="Olson-TZ"/> ;
              For example: <spanx style="verb">America/Los_Angeles</spanx>.</t>

              <t hangText="active"><vspace/>A Boolean value indicating the
              user's administrative status. The definitive meaning of this
              attribute is determined by the service provider. As a typical
              example, a value of true infers the user is able to login while
              a value of false implies the user's account has been
              suspended.</t>

              <t hangText="password"><vspace/>The user's clear text password.
              This attribute is intended to be used as a means to specify an
              initial password when creating a new User or to reset an
              existing User's password. Password policies and the ability to
              update or set passwords are out of scope of this document. The
              mutability of this attribute is <spanx style="verb">writeOnly</spanx>
              indicating the value MUST NOT be returned by a service provider
              in any form.</t>

              target="RFC3966"/> e.g. 'tel:+1-201-555-0123'. Service providers
              SHOULD canonicalize the value according to <xref

              <t hangText="ims"><vspace/>Instant messaging address for the
              user. No official canonicalization rules exist for all instant
              messaging addresses, but service providers SHOULD, when
              appropriate, remove all whitespace and convert the address to
              lowercase. Instead of the standard canonical values for type,
              this attribute defines the following canonical values to

              file (e.g. a GIF, JPEG, or PNG image file) rather than to a web
              page containing an image. Service providers MAY return the same
              image at different sizes, though it is recognized that no
              standard for describing images of various sizes currently
              exists. Note that this attribute SHOULD NOT be used to send down

              photos of the user suitable for display when describing the
              user. Instead of the standard canonical values for type, this
              attribute defines the following canonical values to represent
              popular photo sizes: <spanx style="verb">photo</spanx>, <spanx

              <t hangText="groups"><vspace/>A list of groups that the user
              belongs to, either thorough direct membership, nested groups, or
              dynamically calculated. The values are meant to enable
              expression of common group or role based access control models,
              although no explicit authorization model is defined. It is
              intended that the semantics of group membership and any behavior
              or authorization granted as a result of membership are defined
              by the service provider. The canonical types <spanx
              style="verb">direct</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">indirect</spanx>
              are defined to describe how the group membership was derived.
              Direct group membership indicates the user is directly
              associated with the group and SHOULD indicate that clients may
              modify membership through the <spanx style="verb">Group</spanx>
              resource. Indirect membership indicates user membership is
              transitive or dynamic and implies that clients cannot modify
              indirect group membership through the <spanx style="verb">Group</spanx>
              resource but MAY modify direct group membership through the
              <spanx style="verb">Group</spanx> resource which MAY influence
              indirect memberships. If the SCIM service provider exposes a
              Group resource, the <spanx style="verb">value</spanx>
              sub-attribute MUST be the <spanx style="verb">id</spanx> and the

              of the corresponding <spanx style="verb">Group</spanx> resources
              to which the user belongs. Since this attribute has a mutability
              of <spanx style="verb">readOnly</spanx>, group membership
              changes MUST be applied via the <xref

              <t hangText="entitlements"><vspace/>A list of entitlements for
              the user that represent a thing the user has. An entitlement MAY
              be an additional right to a thing, object, or service. No
              vocabulary or syntax is specified and service providers and
              clients are expected to encode sufficient information in the
              value so as to accurately and without ambiguity determine what
              the user has access to. This value has NO canonical types though
              type may be useful as a means to scope entitlements.</t>

              <t hangText="roles"><vspace/>A list of roles for the user that
              collectively represent who the user is; e.g., <spanx
              style="verb">Student, Faculty</spanx>. No vocabulary or syntax
              is specified though it is expected that a role value is a String
              or label representing a collection of entitlements. This value
              has NO canonical types.</t>

                  resource creation (e.g. POST) or at record replacement via
                  request (e.g. a PUT). The attribute SHALL NOT be
                  updated.</t>

                  <t hangText="writeOnly">The attribute MAY be updated at any
                  time. Attribute values SHALL NOT be returned (e.g. because
                  the value is a stored hash). Note: an attribute with
                  mutability of <spanx style="verb">writeOnly</spanx> usually
                  also has a returned setting of <spanx style="verb">never</spanx>.</t>
                </list></t>

              <t hangText="returned">A single keyword that indicates when an
              attribute and associated values are returned in response to a
              GET request or in response to a PUT, POST, or PATCH request.
              Valid keywords are: <list style="hanging">
                  <t hangText="always">The attribute is always returned
                  regardless of the contents of the <spanx style="verb">attributes</spanx>
                  parameter. For example, <spanx style="verb">id</spanx> is
                  always returned to identify a SCIM resource.</t>

                  <t hangText="never">The attribute is never returned. This
                  may occur because the original attribute value is not
                  retained by the service provider (e.g. such as with a hashed
                  value). A service provider MAY allow attributes to be used
                  in a search filter.</t>

                  <t hangText="default">The attribute is returned by default
                  in all SCIM operation responses where attribute values are
                  returned. If the GET request <spanx style="verb">attributes</spanx>
                  parameter is specified, attribute values are only returned
                  if the attribute is named in the attributes parameter.
                  DEFAULT.</t>

                  <t hangText="request">The attribute is returned in response
                  to any PUT, POST, or PATCH operations if the attribute was
                  specified by the client (for example, the attribute was
                  modified). The attribute is returned in a SCIM query
                  operation only if specified in the <spanx style="verb">attributes</spanx>
                  parameter.</t>
                </list></t>

              <t hangText="uniqueness">A single keyword value that specifies
              how the service provider enforces uniqueness of attribute
              values. A server MAY reject an invalid value based on uniqueness
              by returning HTTP Response code 400 (Bad Request). A client MAY
              enforce uniqueness on the client-side to a greater degree than
              the service provider enforces. For example, a client could make
              a value unique while the server has uniqueness of <spanx
              style="verb">none</spanx>. Valid keywords are: <list
                  style="hanging">
                  <t hangText="none">The values are not intended to be unique
                  in any way. DEFAULT.</t>

                  <t hangText="server">The value SHOULD be unique within the
                  context of the current SCIM endpoint (or tenancy) and MAY be
                  globally unique (e.g. a <spanx style="verb">username</spanx>,
                  email address, or other server generated key or counter). No
                  two resources on the same server SHOULD possess the same
                  value.</t>

                  <t hangText="global">The value SHOULD be globally unique
                  (e.g. an email address, a GUID, or other value). No two
                  resources on any server SHOULD possess the same value.</t>
                </list></t>

              <t hangText="referenceTypes">The names of the resource types
              that may be referenced; e.g., <spanx style="verb">User</spanx>.
              This is only applicable for attributes that are of the <spanx

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations" toc="default">
      <t>The SCIM Core schema defines attributes that MAY contain personally
      identifiable information as well as other sensitive data. Aside from
      prohibiting password values in a SCIM response this specification does
      not provide any means or guarantee of confidentiality.</t>

      <t>In particular, attributes such as <spanx style="verb">id</spanx> and
      <spanx style="verb">externalId</spanx> are of particular concern as
      personally identifiable information that uniquely map to Users (because
      they are URIs). Where possible, it is suggested that service providers
      take the following remediations:<list style="symbols">
          <t>Assign and bind identifiers to specific tenants and/or clients.
          When mulitple tenants are able to reference the same resource, they
          should do so via separate identifiers (id or externalId). This
          ensures that separate domains linked to the same information can not
          perform identifier correlation.</t>

          <t>In the case of <spanx style="verb">externalId</spanx>, if
          multiple values are supported, use access control to restrict access
          to the client domain that assigned the <spanx style="verb">externalId</spanx>
          value.</t>

          <t>Ensure that access to data is appropriately restricted to
          authorized parties with a need-to-know.</t>

          <t>When persisted, the appropriate protection mechanisms are in
          place to restrict access by unauthorized parties including
          administrators or parties with access to backup data.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>It is important to note that these considerations are intentionally
      general in nature. Considerations relative to the access protocol are
      out of scope of the core-schema document and are addressed in other SCIM
      specifications.</t>

      <section anchor="schemaReg" title="Registering SCIM Schemas">
        <t>This section defines the process for registering new SCIM schemas
        with IANA. A schema URI is used as a value in the schemas attribute
        (<xref target="schema"/>) for the purpose of distinguishing extensions
        used in a SCIM resource.</t>

        <section title="Registration Procedure">
          <t>The IETF has created a mailing list, scim@ietf.org, which can be
          used for public discussion of SCIM schema proposals prior to
          registration. Use of the mailing list is strongly encouraged. The
          IESG has appointed a designated expert who will monitor the
          scim@ietf.org mailing list and review registrations.</t>

          <t>Registration of new schemas MUST be reviewed by the designated
          expert and published in an RFC. A Standards Track RFC is REQUIRED
          for the registration of new value data types that modify existing
          properties. A Standards Track RFC is also REQUIRED for registration
          of SCIM schema URIs that modify SCIM schema previously documented in
          a Standards Track RFC.</t>

          <t>The registration procedure begins when a completed registration
          template, defined in the sections below, is sent to scim@ietf.org
          and iana@iana.org. Within two weeks, the designated expert is
          expected to tell IANA and the submitter of the registration whether
          the registration is approved, approved with minor changes, or
          rejected with cause. When a registration is rejected with cause, it
          can be re-submitted if the concerns listed in the cause are
          addressed. Decisions made by the designated expert can be appealed
          to the IESG Applications Area Director, then to the IESG. They
          follow the normal appeals procedure for IESG decisions.</t>

          <t>Once the registration procedure concludes successfully, IANA
          creates or modifies the corresponding record in the SCIM schema
          registry. The completed registration template is discarded.</t>

          <t>An RFC specifying new schema URI MUST include the completed
          registration templates, which MAY be expanded with additional
          information. These completed templates are intended to go in the
          body of the document, not in the IANA Considerations section. The
          RFC SHOULD include any attributes defined.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Schema Registration Template">
          <t>A SCIM schema URI is defined by completing the following
          template: <list style="hanging">

              schema extension.</t>

              defining the resource type (e.g. "Device").</t>

              <t hangText="Purpose:">A description of the purpose of the
              extension and/or its intended use.</t>

              single-valued attributes defined including complex
