# Getting involved #

The SCIM WG is an open, collaborative, and loosely organized group of SaaS providers, vendors and others with a vested interest in simplifying and standardizing 'identity in the cloud'.  Anyone is welcome to join the fray at anytime.  To get started simply join the conversation at http://groups.google.com/group/cloud-directory.

If you would like to contribute language to the specifications you must first sign the [OWF CLA](http://www.openwebfoundation.org/legal/the-owf-1-0-agreements).  After signing post the signed CLA to the [WG alias](http://groups.google.com/group/cloud-directory) and we'll add it to the list.

If you have specific needs or wants, say a new attribute added to the core schema, [enter a new ticket](http://code.google.com/p/scim/issues/list), make your case for it in the description section and send a note to the cloud-directory group.  A well reasoned argument for change goes a long way.

Weekly conference calls are held to discuss issues better suited for synchronous conversations.  Feel free to join in.  The call day/time occasionally floats so check here for the latest [dial-in details](WeeklyWGTeleconference.md).
