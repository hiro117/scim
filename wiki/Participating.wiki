The SCIM WG is an open, collaborative, and loosely organized group of SaaS providers, vendors and others with a vested interest in simplifying and standardizing 'identity in the cloud'.  Anyone is welcome to join the fray at anytime.  To get started simply join the conversation at http://groups.google.com/group/cloud-directory.  

If you would like to contribute language to the specifications you must first sign the [http://www.openwebfoundation.org/legal/the-owf-1-0-agreements OWF CLA].  After signing post the signed CLA to the mailing list and we'll add it to the list. 

Weekly conference calls are held to discuss issues better suited for synchronous conversations.  Feel free to join in.  The call day/time occasionally floats so check here for the latest [Wee dial-in details].
