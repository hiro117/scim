#summary TC Notes for 18Jan2012

= Proposed topics =

  * Set expectations, publicly, on the IETF push.  There's fear growing that implementors might wait for IETF ratification before adoption.  Obviously, that would be a very long wait and there is no guarantee IETF will absorb the spec.  In addition, while developing the spec we made it clear that the intent was to maintain the integrity of the 1.0 spec throughout the process.  That is, no gratutious changes would be introduced to break backwards compatibility though new features would certainly be introduced.  In short, bringing SCIM into the IETF fold should be perceived as a good thing, not a blocker to adoption.    

  * Implementors

  * Interop (IETF and IIW, logistics, test plan, who's coming)

  * New features/changes

  * SAML binding
